# Introduction

This Python package generates a guidance trajectory for complete coverage in 2 dimensions. It can be used for operations where complete coverage of an Area of Interest (AoI) is required for various applications. It is an updated Python implementation of the coverage method discussed in [this paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.5772/56248).
