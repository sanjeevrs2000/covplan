# Coverage Path Planning (CPP)

## What is it useful for?
This repository contains a program which generates a guidance trajectory for complete 2D coverage. It can be used for operations where complete coverage of an Area of Interest (AoI) is required, for land or marine applications.

## How to use the program
To use the program, run `coverage_path_planner.cpp(input_file, params)`. It returns a list of coordinates that constitute the path for complete coverage.
In the input file, describe the boundaries of the AoI using its lat-lon coordinates like this:  
```
  lat1  lon1
  lat2  lon2
  ...
  lat1  lon1
  NaN  NaN
```
Ensure that the AoI is a closed polygon, by keeping the first coordinate the same as the last coordinate. Separate different polygons by including a `NaN NaN` at the end. Also ensure that the coordinates of the polygon are described clockwise, and counter-clockwise for any obstacles and forbidden regions.
`coverage_path_planner.find_min(input_file, params)` runs a single objective optimizer to find the driving angle that minimizes the trajectory length for a given AoI and the specified parameters.
